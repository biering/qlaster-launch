    Hi! Nowadays we have many different social networks and services for different needs.
    What if you could link your account with various common social networks and create, share and adapt your newsfeed, so called streams, to your needs to only see what you want to see?
    Filter for the content not for the user, everywhere.
    We want to reinvent social media with <b>qlaster</b>.
    <br /><br />
    This page is used to build qlaster with the help of the community. We will discuss ideas, specifications and implementations.
