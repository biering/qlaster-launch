&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we have many different social networks and services for different needs. At the one hand this is very good for the individuality and a broad range of social media but on the other hand, it’s hard to see only what you want to see and to not lose the overview. Often you can only subscribe or connect to a specific user without focusing on the content. What if you want to get specific content from a wide spectrum of sources? Register to different networks and subscribe every user who could have something to do with that topic? Why don’t you let &lt;strong&gt;qlaster&lt;/strong&gt; do that for you?&lt;/p&gt;
