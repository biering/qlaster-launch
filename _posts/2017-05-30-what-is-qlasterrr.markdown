**qlaster provides a platform to offer an interactive visualization of a large quantity of social media information, activities and events for the casual user.**

##### In our context the following terms means:
- **information**: data about the users and the relationships between them
- **activities**: for example when an other user posts a new topic or someone sends you a message
- **events**: could be a upcoming party or something like this

#### The current situation.

The main big players in the area of social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and so on, irritate the functionality in this area very well. However, they don't offer an **optimal solution to display and interact with this large quantity of data**. Often the views are limited only to lists when providing a lot of data. In addition meta information, like the _from-where-I-know-who relationship_ are difficult to obtain.
In the moment social information and relationships between them are only visualized for science use. We try to make it usable for the casual user.

Another big point is the large number of different social platforms. On the one hand this is a good thing, because many different platforms provides a lot of varying services. But on the other hand, especially when the user is on a network only because of connecting to his friends, it is annoying to communicate in so many different ways. Thats why we try to give the possibility[^1] to connect the account with other social services to use qlaster as something like a dashboard for social media. For example you can get the newest Tweets from Twitter while chatting with someone at Google+.

#### With our concept you can see alot of information in an awesome way.

qlaster visualizes social media information, in an interactive graphical way. So you don't only see the different information, activities and events but can also manage them easily.
Thereby it is possible to:

1. provide an _**intuitive**_ view to interact _**fast**_ with the content,
2. work _**modern**_ and _**productive**_ with the social network,
3. display a lot of meta information[^2] very easily.

We use a cluster to visualize these contents. The different possibilities of visualization will be presented later and evaluated with the community. In this article the goal is to get feedback on the main idea.

We focus different platforms where qlaster should work. Especially the mobile version is a challenge because of the size of the device.

#### The Team.

- **Christoph Biering**. _Founder_ - Master student of computer science at the TU Dresden. I have started the project and partly 'll take care of the conception. Development of the webserver with the frontend.

- **Christian Winkel**. _Co-Founder_ - Master of computer science. Professional JavaEE developer. Developing on the backend JavaEE server.

- **Lars Engeln**. _Co-Founder_ - Master student of media computer science at the TU Dresden. Developing of the visualization through the cluster.


#### What can you do for us?

The demo is already developed relatively far, but everyone in our team is working at qlaster as an addition to their employment or study. So we can't develop the whole application without getting feedback for the idea.

At this point we need you. What do you think about the idea? Can you imagine to use this application? Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Please leave a comment or send an email to the.chryb@icloud.com.
Thank you very much!

[^2]: Meta information: information that could display indirectly in the visualization like the activities of users, circles of friends or something like that.
